        <p contenteditable="true" style="border: 1px dashed burlywood; text-align: center;">When I landed in Dubai, my life would be easier because of my dubbies <br>
            Who had promised me some financial help as soon as I got here.<br>
            These friends, <i><b>Sako Bolafesa Samba</b></i>, Youri Lemba, Maxence Ndumbi <br>
            ,and more, never fulfilled their promises because it was unwise to make<br>
            me keep hopes up, but as human nature is always  bad or deceitful, <br>
            I fell victim of their trust, which I was not supposed to believe in.<br>
            It's said the lives of the greats are built  upon struggles, but my life <br>
            has always been kind of tragedy for some unknown reasons. Sometimes, I wish <br>
            I could not be a human because if being a human-being makes people happy, but <br>
            for me I've always felt apart of any big plans or never felt like anything.<br>
